It was a malicious (obfuscating itself, performing tasks without user knowledge spying software, and encrypting the output) software done as a test of antivirus detection, and both signature-based detection and heuristic analysis failed miserably for the antivirus software, including after "compiling" to .exe file.

The test also included services such as www.virustotal.com - a way to check, in one go, if the files are flagged as malicious by many commercial antivirus products. 

Back then (2019-2020), and perhaps still today, antivirus software simply couldn't cope with potentially malicious or self-hiding software written in interpreter-type languages. This is a lesson in security, and potentially in not running freeware closed-source software. Probabilities in this case add up with each closed-source software used. Virtual-machines/Sandboxie or similar should be more of a standard.
