you can modify file attributes programatically, e.g. file creation time etc. to further obfuscate your work
    check if you can do so on an open file

you could load which window titles you want to skip from a file, which is encrypted with something like rot13 and base64



Make sure it only executes once

    read the file, from globalVariables.path
        if unable, or there in no such file then set unwantedWindowTitles as an empty set
    transform it with base64
        transform that with rot13
            now put that into unwantedWindowTitles var, as a set
